Websites that work for me:
www.google.com
www.amazon.com
gaia.cs.umass.edu
info.cern.ch

If you store a webpage in the cache, and then try to search the website, mhen you refresh, it renders the underlying sense HTML on the website. But it still successfully stores the cache and the TA said this was fine!
Might have to restart the server if you wanna try several websites like facebook first and THEN google! 
Also, it'll take a little while to load a website, it might take 10-20 seconds. Thanks!
