For Part A: 
-Webserver, if the image does not render, please refresh and it works successfully !

For Part B:
-Please don't forget to remove the '/' at the very end. For example for http://captive.apple.com/ change it to http://captive.apple.com

HTTP ONLY WEBSITES THAT WORKED FOR ME:

http://captive.apple.com

http://example.com 

http://info.cern.ch

http://http.badssl.com

http://neverssl.com

http://http-textarea.badssl.com

http://gaia.cs.umass.edu


Part B Notes:
-If you store a webpage in the cache, and then try to search the website, mhen you refresh, it renders the underlying sense HTML on the website. But it still successfully stores the cache and the TA Tyler Osborne said this was fine.

-Might have to restart the server if you wanna try several websites in succession like google -> amazon. But maybe you won't have to do this.

-Sometimes, if you search for a webpage for the first time, it will redirect you to amazon and won't cache it properly. 

-Also, it might take a little while to load a website, perhaps 10-20 seconds. Thanks for your patience.
